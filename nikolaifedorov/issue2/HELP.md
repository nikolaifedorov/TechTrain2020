# Getting Started

## Clean
$ ./gradlew clean

## Build jar
$ ./gradlew build

## Run app
$ java -jar build/libs/rest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

## Build Docker image and tag it
$ docker build --build-arg JAR_FILE=build/libs/*.jar -t techtrain2020/issue2-kotlin-spring-boot-docker .

## Run Docker image
$ docker run -p 8081:8081 techtrain2020/issue2-kotlin-spring-boot-docker

## DOTO
I use localhost:8080 in container, but app locates outside container.
We need use shared network between Docker containers or use docker-compose.
